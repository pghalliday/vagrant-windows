Installing Vagrant-Windows
==========================

For Vagrant 1.1.x and 1.2.x execute `vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows`.
For Vagrant 1.0.x execute `vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows --plugin-version 0.1.2`.

### Installing Vagrant-Windows From Source
If you want to install from source, use the following method (this would be for 1.2.0):

```
 bundle install
 bundle exec rake
 vagrant plugin install pkg/vagrant-windows-1.2.0.gem
```

Keep in mind you should have Ruby 1.9.3 and Ruby DevKit installed. Check out the following gist that can get you what you need (from blank system to fully ready): [Install Vagrant Windows Plugin From Source Gist](https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/6251225).

To install from source
----------------------

With ruby 1.9.3-p448

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
$ vagrant plugin install pkg/vagrant-windows-1.2.0.gem
```

If you have firewall problems with the git protocol then try this before `bundle install`

```
$ git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

Supported Guest Operating Systems (Your VM)
===========================================
_Does NOT work with Windows 2003 or XP_

- Windows 7
- Windows 2008
- Windows 2008 R2
- Windows 2012
- Windows 8

Building a Base Box
===================

All Windows Machines
-------------------- 
#### Prerequisites

Box setup:

  - Create a vagrant user, for things to work out of the box username and password should both be "vagrant".
  - Turn off UAC (Msconfig)
  - Disable complex passwords

Prior to enabling WinRM, you must ensure the following services are enabled:

  - Base Filtering Engine
    - Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
      - DCOM Server Process Launcher
      - RPC Endpoint Mapper
  - Windows Firewall
  - Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)

#### Enable WinRM
```
   winrm quickconfig -q
   winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="512"}
   winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}
   winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
   winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
```
* note
If you want to run the winrm commands from PowerShell you need to put ```@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="512"}``` etc in single quotes:

```
   winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="512"}'
```

#### Last steps 

  - Optional: Start WinRM a few minutes faster by running: "sc config WinRM start= auto" (default is delayed-auto)
    - _Note:_ When you use the `winrm` command line tool it will always ask to set the startup to Delayed, so you may find yourself performing this a few times.

  
Windows 2008/2012 Servers (except Core)
---------------------------------------
  - [Disable Shutdown Tracker](http://www.jppinto.com/2010/01/how-to-disable-the-shutdown-event-tracker-in-server-20032008/)
  - [Disable "Server Manager" Starting at login](http://www.elmajdal.net/win2k8/How_to_Turn_Off_The_Automatic_Display_of_Server_Manager_At_logon.aspx)
  
The Vagrant File
================

Add the following to your Vagrantfile

```ruby
config.vm.guest = :windows
config.windows.halt_timeout = 25
config.winrm.username = "vagrant"
config.winrm.password = "vagrant"
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5985, host: 5985
```

Example:
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  
  # Max time to wait for the guest to shutdown
  config.windows.halt_timeout = 25
  
  # Admin user name and password
  config.winrm.username = "vagrant"
  config.winrm.password = "vagrant"

  # Configure base box parameters
  config.vm.box = "vagrant-windows2008r2"
  config.vm.box_url = "./vagrant-windows2008r2.box"
  config.vm.guest = :windows

  # Port forward WinRM and RDP
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3389, host: 3389
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5985, host: 5985
  
end
````

Available Config Parameters:

* ```config.windows.halt_timeout``` - How long Vagrant should wait for the guest to shutdown before forcing exit, defaults to 30 seconds
* ```config.windows.halt_check_interval``` - How often Vagrant should check if the system has shutdown, defaults to 1 second
* ```config.windows.set_work_network``` - Force network adapters to "Work Network". Useful for Win7 guests using private networking.
* ```config.winrm.username``` - The Windows guest admin user name, defaults to vagrant.
* ```config.winrm.password``` - The above's password, defaults to vagrant.
* ```config.winrm.host``` - The IP of the guest, but because we use NAT with port forwarding this defaults to localhost.
* ```config.winrm.guest_port``` - The guest's WinRM port, defaults to 5985.
* ```config.winrm.port``` - The WinRM port on the host, defaults to 5985. You might need to change this if your hosts is also Windows.
* ```config.winrm.max_tries``` - The number of retries to connect to WinRM, defaults to 20.
* ```config.winrm.timeout``` - The max number of seconds to wait for a WinRM response, defaults to 1800 seconds.

Note - You need to ensure you specify a config.windows and a config.winrm in your Vagrantfile. Currently there's a problem where
Vagrant will not load the plugin config even with defaults if at least one of its values doesn't exist in the Vagrantfile.


What Works?
===========
- vagrant up|halt|reload|provision
- Chef Vagrant Provisioner
- Puppet Vagrant Provisioner
- Shell Vagrant provisioner. Batch files or PowerShell (ps1) scripts are supported as well as inline scripts.

TODOs
=========
1. Test it! We need to test on more hosts, guests, and VBox versions. Help wanted.
2. Chef-Client support.
3. Unit tests. 
4. Better docs.

Troubleshooting
===============

I get a 401 auth error from WinRM
---------------------------------
- Ensure you've followed the WinRM configuration instructions above.
- Ensure you can manually login using the specified config.winrm.username you've specified in your Vagrantfile.
- Ensure your password hasn't expired.
- Ensure your password doesn't need to be changed because of policy.

I get a non-401 error from WinRM waiting for the VM to boot
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Ensure you've properly setup port forwarding of WinRM
- Make sure your VM can boot manually through VBox.

SQL Server cookbook fails to install through Vagrant
----------------------------------------------------
- Ensure UAC is turned off
- Ensure your vagrant user is an admin on the guest
- The SQL Server installer uses a lot of resources, ensure WinRM Quota Management is properly configured to give it enough resources.
- See [COOK-1172](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1172) and http://stackoverflow.com/a/15235996/82906 for more information.

If all else fails try running [vagrant with debug logging](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/debugging.html), perhaps that will give
you enough insight to fix the problem or file an issue.

What Can I do to help?
======================
1. Contribute Code (See Below)
2. Test Various Scenarios and file bugs for things that dont work

Contributing
============
1. Fork it.
2. Create a branch (git checkout -b my_feature_branch)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am "Added a sweet feature")
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my_feature_branch)
5. Create a pull requst from your branch into master (Please be sure to provide enough detail for us to cipher what this change is doing)

Development
=============
Clone this repository and use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

Once you have the dependencies, you can run the tests with `rake`:

```
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

If those pass, you're ready to start developing the plugin. You can test
the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by just
creating a [Vagrantfile](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/packaging.html)
in the top level of this directory (it is gitignored) that uses it, and
use bundler to execute Vagrant:

```
$ bundle exec vagrant up
```
